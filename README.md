Repository with some applications developed by me in Python

Repository with some applications developed by me in Python. This repository includes some projects and models that I made in the year 2024.

Courses I took in 2024 in Python:

2024 - 2024 - 
Python and Data Analysis Course - FEA.Dev (USP - University of São Paulo)

Programming logic, that is, the sequence of steps that the computer executes for the desired command. To do this, it is necessary to assign variables according to their nature (type) and organize them (lists, tuples, matrices, etc.); Build conditionals to address different scenarios of the hypothesis and repeat them as many times as necessary using loops; Structure functions with the desired arguments and explore libraries (Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, etc.); Analyze databases: from extraction to visualization.

2024 - 2024 -
